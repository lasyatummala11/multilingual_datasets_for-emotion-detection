# Multilingual Datasets for Emotion Detection

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring emotion detection across multiple languages, with a particular focus on Hindi. It encompasses a collection of datasets, preprocessing scripts, and model implementations aimed at facilitating research and development in multilingual emotion recognition.

## Contents

* **Datasets**: Curated datasets in various languages, including Hindi, for emotion analysis.
* **Preprocessing Scripts**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts for data cleaning, normalization, and preparation.
* **Model Implementations**: Notebooks demonstrating different modeling approaches for emotion detection.
* **Project Proposal**: Documentation outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes.

## Datasets

* **Hindi-NRC-EmoLex.txt**: A lexicon mapping Hindi words to associated emotions, derived from the NRC Emotion Lexicon.
* **News Articles**: Datasets extracted from various Hindi news sources such as ABN, Dainik Jagaran, Sakshi, and Eenadu, used for emotion analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregation of textual data from diverse Hindi news outlets.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalization of text data using scripts provided in the notebooks.
3. **Emotion Mapping**: Utilizing the Hindi-NRC-EmoLex to associate words and phrases with specific emotions.
4. **Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to detect and classify emotions in the text data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
